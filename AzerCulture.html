    <div style="background-color: bisque;"><b>There were a lot of significant periods during history that primarily affected Azerbaijan's cultures and traditions. The switch in religion and actions of different governments has led to changes in the culture of the nation. Caucasian Albania is believed to be the first state in modern-day Azerbaijan’s territories. After Muslim Arabs defeated the Sassanid and Byzantine empires they entered the Caucasus. Most of Azerbaijan was converted to Islam and it still remains the major religion in the country. Later many dynasties were established in Azerbaijan's history, the Safavid empire was one of them, it was first founded in 1501 and Shia Islam started to rise, in the 21st century Shia Islam still claims to be the largest religion in the country. After two wars between Russia and Qajars the Treaty of Gulistan and the Treaty of Turkmenchay were signed. In terms of the treaties Qajars had to leave Caucasian territories, and Azerbaijani khanates were involved in Russia. Until April 28 1918 Azerbaijan was under Russian rule. In 1918 the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was created for the first time. Shortly After 2 years on April 28, 1920, Azerbaijan ceased to be independent of the Soviet Union. 71 years Azerbaijan was under Soviet rule and only in October 1991 October 18 it could gain its independence back.</b></div>

Modern times music is not really consideret as a part of the culture yet even with their great popularity.Baku Academy of Music was established to provide classical artists with the same support as folk musicians in 1920, when Azerbaijani classical music had experienced an upsurge.When Azerbaijani musicians first encountered European musical traditions throughout the Imperial Russian and Soviet eras of the country's history, opera and ballet began to flourish in Azerbaijan. Opera singers from Azerbaijan who achieved international recognition include Bulbul, Shovkat Mammadova, Fatma Mukhtarova, Huseyngulu Sarabski, Hagigat Rzayeva, Rashid Behbudov, Rauf Atakishiyev, Muslim Magomayev, Fidan and Khuraman Gasimovas, Rubaba Muradova, and Zeynab Khanlarova.The majority of songs are historical accounts of actual situations or tales from Azerbaijani folklore, or they are the result of competitions amongst medieval poets. Folk songs are typically played during weddings, funerals, and unique celebrations, in keeping with their origins.Ashiqs are traveling bards who sing and play the saz. Their tunes are semi-improvised Around a shared basis. It is  regarded as a sign of national identity and considered a protector of the Azerbaijani language, literature, and music. Meykhana is a particular literary and folk rap genre, consists of an improvised song played by one or more individuals without any musical accompaniment about a specific topic.

The selection of a certain mugham and performing style is suitable for a certain situation. Increasing intensity and rising pitches are frequently linked to the dramatic development of a performance, as well as a type of poetic-musical communication between artists and engaged audiences. </p>

These differences have definite benefits.Saz's arm is composed of walnut wood, while its body is constructed from certain varieties of mulberry trees. Wooden ribs linked to each other in an odd number form the body of the sculpture. An arm is added after the ribs are put together on tiny "kup" pieces that link the arm and torso.
